A demo done with Analog, Nx & TRPC showcasing a way of retaining the type-safety & ease-of-use of TRPC while being able to compose routers & client provider components in multiple applications.

The application would provide any middleware it deems necessary for protectedRoutes & any required context, which could be defined in the libraries through the CTX generic.

This application currently does not run due to nitro mis-compiling nx libs.
